docker compose (creating multi containers and microservices) 
============================================

With Compose, we define a multi-container application in a single file, then spin our application up in a single command which does everything that needs to be done to get it running.

The main function of Docker Compose is the creation of microservice architecture, meaning the containers and the links between them.

Compared with docker commands, the docker-compose commands are not only similar, but they also behave like docker counterparts. The only difference is that docker-compose commands affect the entire multi-container architecture defined in the docker-compose.yml configuration file and not just a single container.

There are three steps to use Docker Compose:
===============================================

Define each service in a Dockerfile.
Define the services and their relation to each other in the docker-compose.yml file.
Use # docker-compose up to start the system.
